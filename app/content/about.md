# About Janax Forum Framework #

The Janax Framework is a ready-to-use PHP MVC (Model View Controller) Framework,
complete with a default responsive theme and jQuery/JavaScript integration. 
The theme and default setup is designed to be used as a automobile or autosport 
forum or Q&A page, although you can exchange the built-in racing game or question tags 
as you wish, to better fit the needs of your project. It lets your website visitor 
register as a user, create a profile, ask questions or answer questions. The user 
can also write news articles by default. The requirements to write an article can be 
changed at your discretion, however. The user can also play a simple HTML5 Canvas 
racing game which is included, and save the laptimes and number of laps to be displayed in
the profile. This allows users to compete against each other for the best laptime!

All this comes with modern and discrete jQuery animations to give your visitors a great experience!

Some of the features included in Janax are:

* **Client- and Server-side form validation to guide your visitors when filling out forms**

* **jQuery animations in the navbar, forms and buttons**

* **An animated sign-in button and a scroll-to-top button for easy use**

* **Integrated HTML5 Canvas racing game with saveable laptimes**

* **News section with structured data markup to show rich snippets in Google Search results**

* **Questions and Answers question with built-in mail service to notify a user of answered questions**

* **User profile page and reputation points, rewarding active users**

* **Mobile friendly and responsive theme**

* **Secure password restoration if a user forgets his or her password**

There will be more features added continually, like voting on questions or answers,
writing reviews among other things. Here are some of the features coming in future updates:

* **User reviews**

* **Comment voting**

* **Image gallery**

* **Search function**

* **Image upload function when writing an article**

*To use new features, you'll need to download and install the Janax repository again*


## Why Janax Forum Framework?##

There are quite a few MVC Frameworks out there, so why would you want to use Janax for your website?

Well, **first of all**, Janax is for the intermediate-level programmer who wants 
a ready-built template website where you only need to add your own content and do 
some small configurations. There's no need for advanced programming, except if you want
to develop or adapt the default theme, add new features or any other changes. 

Janax is simpler to use than MVC frameworks like Symfony or Zend, which need some programming skills.
These frameworks are, of course, more advanced and flexible than Janax, with a lot more 
possibilities to add plugins or components according to your advanced needs.
However, if you quickly want to create your own Q&A, forum or blog website, without the limitations
of blog services like Blogger or Wordpress, Janax is something for you!

**Secondly**, Janax contains a built-in racing game which is fully integrated into
the website, allowing users to save laptimes and number of laps raced, and show 
them in their profile page, a feature you will hardly find in other frameworks. 
The front page of the application shows a list of users with the fastest laptimes 
and also the users with most reputation points. It's a great way to attract users
and promote activity on your site by letting them gain reputation points or laptimes, 
trying to be among the top users who are displayed at the front of your site!

**Thirdly**, you will get a clean and beautiful responsive website theme from the start,
along with gentle jQuery animations which are not "too much", but give a better 
visual experience to your user than the traditional and sterile "windows and text" 
forum websites of the nineties, which are still common today. The theme is clean and simple, 
without the noisy small links and pieces of text all over the place!

**Lastly**, one of the main features is the news section, which from the start gives 
you or any user, if you choose, a simple way to write news content which comes 
with structured data markup, so that your news can be displayed as a news article 
on Google search results. The only thing you need to do is to register, login, 
and start to write a header, the full name of the author and content of your article. 
Janax handles the rest! As an option, you may want to upload an image and enter the filename.

I sincerely hope that you will have a great time using Janax to create your website!
