# This is how you use Janax Forum Framework! #

It's easy!

1. Create a [profile](users/add).

2. Add a profile picture/avatar in <a href="https://sv.gravatar.com" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>
if you haven't already. If your e-mail adress is correct, your gravatar will automatically be visible
in your [profile](users).

3. [Log in](users/login) with your created user.

4. [Ask a question](question/add) or answer a question already asked. 
Each question has one or several [<span class='tag-label'>tags</span>](question/list-tags). Look
through the questions in the tag page that you have some knowledge about or look through 
[all questions](question). When someone answers your question, you will receive a notification e-mail. 
Automatic e-mails are sometimes filtered as spam, so be sure to check your spam mail 
and label mail sent from ['admin@mydomain.com'] as safe.

5. This website is all about questions and answers about Janax Framework (though new features will be added soon)!
However, if you have some general questions about taste or opinion, please refer to 
the [<span class='tag-label'>general</span>](question/list/general) tag or the comment section
of a question. Leave the 'answers' section only to answers to the specific question.
Questions not related to the subject of the website, or are violent, threatening, harassing,
abusive, discriminating, sexual or unserious in nature will be deleted immediately.

6. Avoid asking questions already asked; if possible, go through the questions of your 
tag before you ask the question. In the future, there will probably be a search function
so that you can search the site for question with keywords. 

7. For every question, answer or comment you write, you will be awarded with reputation points (<i class="fa fa-trophy fa-1x gold"></i>)!
Besides the great honor of having your username and website link on the frontpage if you reach the top ranks, 
there will be no other reward or payment for these. Special privileges like titles
or badges may be introduced in the future. If you delete a question, an answer or a comment,
the corresponding <i class="fa fa-trophy fa-1x gold"></i> will also be subtracted, 
together with penalty points.
This is to encourage comments that are thought through and to discourage spam and the like.

Have fun!
